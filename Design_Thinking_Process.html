        <h1>Design Thinking Process</h1>
        <p class="dt-intro">
            Design thinking is a user-centered approach to problem solving and innovation. For this website, I followed the five key stages of design thinking to ensure the site is both visually appealing and highly usable.
        </p>

            <div class="dt-step">
                <h2>1. Empathize</h2>
                <p>I started by understanding the needs and expectations of my target usersâ€”students, teachers, and potential collaborators. I conducted informal interviews and gathered feedback on what makes a portfolio website engaging and easy to navigate.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="dt-step">
                <h2>2. Define</h2>
                <p>Based on the insights, I defined the main problems: users want quick access to my projects, a clear sense of my skills, and a visually pleasing experience. I summarized these needs into clear design goals for the site.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="dt-step">
                <h2>3. Ideate</h2>
                <p>I brainstormed multiple layouts, color schemes, and interactive features. Sketches and wireframes helped me explore different ways to present my work and personality, while keeping usability in mind.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="dt-step">
                <h2>4. Prototype</h2>
                <p>I created a working prototype of the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This allowed me to quickly test ideas, adjust the navigation, and refine the visual style before finalizing the content.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="dt-step">
                <h2>5. Test</h2>
                <p>I shared the prototype with friends and mentors, collecting feedback on usability, accessibility, and aesthetics. Based on their suggestions, I improved the navigation, color contrast, and added more project details.</p>
